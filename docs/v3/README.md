# Version 3.0

The first version was made with a decorator first approach (at least I tried). This approach is elegant but hard to understand
what is going on.

The second approach is "decoratorless" the logic is simpler but we loose the declarative style of decorator.
This approach gives us better way to pass service container trough controller.

## Goals

In this approach I will try to abstract the express application, this way it will be simpler to use decorators.
I will also try to add the swagger ui.
